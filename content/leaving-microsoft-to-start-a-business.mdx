In November 2020, I left Microsoft to pursue entrepreneurship full-time. My business partner and I had been working on Numerro on the side for the last couple of months and it was finally starting to show promise. It was decision time - fully commit to the project or stay at Microsoft. We decided to commit.

The journey since then hasn’t been as straightforward as I naively thought it would be. There were a lot of ups, but there were also many, many downs. And as of recently, I’ve even decided to get back into employment and joined Vercel as a Customer Success Manager.

People have asked me if leaving Microsoft was worth it. Most of the time, they’ve asked me that when things were _not going particularly well._ The answer is nuanced and I am only able to reflect on the whole experience now that I’ve taken a step back from it.

Here is the good and the not-so-good:

## The good

- I learned how to make money on the internet
- I gained flexibility and freedom to choose what I want to work on
- I learned to use many important digital tools as part of my workflow - Figma, Webflow, Notion etc.
- I (together with my co-founder) took an idea from scratch and built it into a $4-5,000/month business that a year later got acquired for $X…
- …which led to me having my first, albeit small, win at the age of 25 and the confidence that I _could_ make something work
- **I learned how to code and build web apps!**
- I gained fundamental knowledge of marketing, design and sales.
- I learned how to work with a co-founder. As a result, I developed a strong business and personal relationship with my partner, who I now consider a very close friend.
- I learned about the Minimum Viable Product framework and how to apply it to any idea I have
- I built many interesting projects that have brought _some_ value to the world. A couple of them are still being actively used to this day - [numerro.io](http://numerro.io), [blackoutpoetry.co](https://blackoutpoetry.co), [thelondonweekend.com](https://thelondonweekend.com)
- I became an active participant in the world of business and tech, instead of just a spectator on the side, who passively consumes Paul G’s essays and YC’s start-up courses, but never does anything about it
- It was fun (most of the time)

## The not-so-good

- Huge financial instability. I didn’t really have a _consistent_ source of income since the sale of Numerro - 2 years ago. Money has come through one-off sales and acquisitions, but I never reached the stage where I could afford to pay myself on a regular basis.
- I was missing a clear feedback loop. In many cases, we would try out a strategy that didn’t work out and we wouldn’t have a clear idea of what went wrong. Was it the messaging? Was it the product? I didn’t have a manager to tell me why that was - I had to figure it out by myself. And that was not easy.
- It was socially restrictive. I wasn’t part of a company or a team anymore, so meeting like-minded people became difficult. I felt like I played the game in a solo mode and I didn’t enjoy that. I missed the team spirit and working on a problem _together with a group of people._
- Finding good problems to solve became difficult. At Microsoft, I was bombarded by different processes, tools and systems, so recognising issues and identifying solutions was not hard. That’s how Numerro started. Working from home, I didn’t get the same luxury.
- Struggling with confidence. When you try 3 things and none of them works out, it’s just inevitable that your confidence will eventually take a hit.
- Struggling with prioritisation. I was in charge of my own time, so I could decide what to do with it. But choosing the _right_ thing to work on was not easy.

## Conclusion

So was quitting Microsoft the right decision? I believe so. If you want to learn how to start a business, go start a business. Or in other words, quitting didn’t help me start a successful company. But quitting did help me acquire some of the skills necessary to start a successful company.

What this is going to lead to - well, we will see…
